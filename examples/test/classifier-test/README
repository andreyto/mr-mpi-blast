* NOTE
  This examples is to show how to run mr-mpi-blast with enabling the
  classifier option to have two more values in the BLAST hit: percentage
  identity and percentage coverage for input query. For conversion, please
  use "load_*_classifier.py" scripts.


* Requirements

    - This document shows how to run mr-mpi-blast using two small query files 
      for running BLAST search against a custom NCBI BLAST database.
    - This assumes that you run mr-mpi-blast on your local machine 
      with a MPI stack installed. The mr-mpi-blast will be started using 
      "mpirun" in the examples.
    - You should run the scripts in order of the number in the file name. 
    - Please refer to "tutorial" for our large-scale experiments.
    - The "$MRMPIBLAST_PREFIX/bin" should be added to the executable search 
      path for running "mrblast" and "makeblastdb" executables, and other 
      Python scripts.
      
      ex) $ export PATH=$MRMPIBLAST_PREFIX/bin:$PATH


    - Utilities for preparing input data and converting output need Python 
      installed. To use HDF5 database format, PyTables package should be 
      installed (http://www.pytables.org/moin)


1. Indexing 30 real sequences

    Scripts: "1.indexing_30_real_seqs.sh"

    - This query data show the case of query sequence in which each sequence 
      has "GI" numbers.
    - The 30 query sequences were selected arbitrarily from NCBI RefSeq viral 
      sequences and saved in "./query/30_real_seqs.fa" file (~100Kbp).
    - Indexing the input query file, "30_real_seqs.fa" generates 
      "./query/30_real_seqs.fa.idx" and "./query/30_real_seqs.fa.def" files.
    - Options used for running seqindexer.py
        -s 1: generate serial query ID starting from "1"
        -b 0: save part of deflines in "30_real_seqs.fa.def"


2. Indexing 100 simulated sequences

    Script: "2.indexing_100_simul_seqs.sh"

    - This query data show the case of simulated query sequence which 
      generated from the above FASTA sequences using "splitter.py". 
    - For this case, we can not use the "GI" numbers as query ID because 
      those are not unique. Each query will be assigned a generated serial 
      number as its unique ID.
    - Generate 100 query sequences (1000bp length) by splitting the RefSeq viral 
      sequences and saved in "100_simul_seqs.fa" file (~100Kbp). 
    - Indexing the input query file, "./query/100_simul_seqs.fa" for mr-mpi-blast run.
    - Options used for running seqindexer.py
        -s 1: generate serial query ID from "1"
        -b 1: save full deflines in "100_real_seqs.fa.def"


3. Make NCBI BLAST formatted database

    Script: "3.makeblastdb.sh"

    - Total 3,728 sequences were arbitrarily chosen from NCBI RefSeq viral 
      sequences and saved in the "./blastdb/test.fa" file (78MB).
    - Using "makeblastdb" utility from NCBI BLAST+ and the input FASTA file, 
      "test.fa", generate BLAST formatted database, names as "test.db".
    - The "test.db" should be set as "DATABASENAME" in the "mrblast.ini" 
      configuration file.
    - The name of the generated BLAST database fragment is specified in the 
      "dblist.txt" so that mr-mpi-blast read the list from the file, and the 
      "dblist.txt" should be set with "DBLISTFILENAME" in the configuration file.
 

4. Run mr-mpi-blast with 30 real sequences against "test.db"

    Script: "4.run_mrblast_30_real.sh"

    * NOTE
      The "ISCLASSIFIER" field in the "mrblast.ini" is set as "1".
      
    - Set BLASTDB environment variable to tell NCBI BLAST code where the
      databases are.
    - Run mr-mpi-blast using mpirun on four processing units. The Block size 
      option, "BLOCKSIZE" in the "mrblast.ini" is set as 5000bp resulting in 
      10 query blocks and 10 (10 query blocks x 1 database file) work items.
    - Do BLAST search using "30_real_seqs.fa" against "test.db" 
      BLAST.
    - The evalue is set as 10.
    - The hit results (./30-real-hits) will be saved in *.bin files and
      converted into CSV, SQLite, and HDF5 database files (./30-real-hits-output).
          

5. Run mr-mpi-blast with 100 simulated sequences against "test.db"

    Script: "5.run_mrblast_100_simul.sh"

    * NOTE
      The "ISCLASSIFIER" field in the "mrblast.ini" is set as "1".
      
    - Set BLASTDB environment variable to tell NCBI BLAST code where the
      databases are.
    - Run mr-mpi-blast using mpirun on four processing units. The Block size 
      option, "BLOCKSIZE" in the "mrblast.ini" is set as 5000bp resulting in 
      20 query blocks and total 20 (20 query blocks x 1 database file) work 
      items.
    - Do BLAST search using "100_simul_seqs.fa" against "test.db" 
      BLAST database. 
    - The evalue is set as 10.
    - The hit results (./100-simul-hits) will be saved in *.bin files and
      converted into CSV, SQLite, and HDF5 database files (./100-simul-hits-output).


6. Run mr-mpi-blast with 30 real sequences against "test.db" by multiple iterations

    * NOTE
      . For multiple iterations, the converting tools do not support the "-d"
        and "-i" options which is for adding the original defline for each query
        ID from "*.def" file.
      . The "ISCLASSIFIER" field in the "mrblast.ini" is set as "1".
      
    Script: "6.run_mrblast_30_real_w_numiter.sh"

    - Set BLASTDB environment variable to tell NCBI BLAST code where the
      databases are.
    - Run mr-mpi-blast with setting "NUMITER" as 2.
    - The iteration number will be added to the resulting hit file names.
    - The hit files (./30-real-hits-numiter) are converted into CSV, SQLite,
      and HDF5 database files (./30-real-hits-numiter-output).
