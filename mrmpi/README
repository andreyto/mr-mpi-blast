This is the MapReduce-MPI library from Sandia National Laboratories. It is 
used for implementing MapReduce part of the mr-mpi-blast. The library is 
modified to add our location-aware scheduler based on the MapReduce-MPI 
version 20Jun2011, which is included in this "mrmpi" subdirectory of the 
source package.
