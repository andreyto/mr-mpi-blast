* Introduction of mr-mpi-blast

    - The mr-mpi-blast program is a parallel implementation of NCBI BLAST+ 
      using the NCBI C++ Toolkit and MapReduce-MPI library and implements a 
      "matrix-split" BLAST search in which a BLAST search job is transformed into 
      searching "n" blocks of query sequences against "m" database partitions. 
    - The work items become pairs <query block, DB partition name>.
    - The program distributes (n x m) work items among "c" processing units 
      ("workers") in a cluster system and each worker runs BLAST search with 
      the assigned pairs of <query block, DB partition name>. Note that 
      c << n x m, in normal case.
    - The mr-mpi-blast assumes a shared file system.
    - The master/worker scheduling option of MapReduce library is used which 
      instructs it to use the process with rank 0 as a master that distributes
      work items to the remaining ranks in a load-balanced way, such that each 
      worker is kept occupied as long as there are remaining work items. 
    - The mr-mpi-blast supports a modified master/worker scheduler in which the 
      master tries best to distribute the work items to those ranks that have
      already been processing the same DB partitions. 
    - The mr-mpi-blast consists of three primary steps. The first and last 
      steps are offline jobs and the second step is done during the actual
      mr-mpi-blast run. First, the input query sequences in a FASTA file 
      are indexed so that mr-mpi-blast loads the file as memory-mapped file 
      and logically splits it into many blocks. Second, the master prepares 
      (n x m) work items and assigns each work item to non-busy workers. Each 
      worker runs BLAST search with the assigned work item. Here the results 
      per work item is accumulated at each worker. For example, if the master 
      assigns "w" work items among (n x m) work items to a worker, where w 
      < n x m, the worker accumulates "w" sets of BLAST results during the 
      whole operation. Finally, each worker saves all the hits to a binary file 
      that is owned by each rank. Finally, all result files are collected and 
      saved to a file.
      
    - Usage examples:
    
        ex) mpirun mrblast -db -
        ex) mpirun mrblast -db - -evalue 1e-4          
        ex) mpirun mrblast -db - -evalue 1e-4 -dbsize 12494903041 
            -num_threads 1 -window_size 0 -word_size 11 -searchsp 0            
            -num_descriptions 500 -num_alignments  10000 -penalty -5 -reward 4 
            -lcase_masking -dust yes -soft_masking true -export_search_strategy 
            strategy_temp.txt -max_target_seqs 2147483647
            
    - The argument, "-db -" is mandatory. The subject database file names 
      should be listed in a text file, for example, "dblist.txt" and the name
      of the text file should be specified as "DBLISTFILENAME" in the 
      mr-mpi-blast configuration file, "mrblast.ini".
    - The query FASTA file and the generated index file should be specified in 
      the configuration file.
	- Most of NCBI blastn and blastp (v.2.2.24+) options are supported except:
      
        . Input query options: -query, -query_loc
        . Database options: -db, -out, -use_index, -index_name, -subject, -subject_loc
        . Formatting options: -outfmt, -show_gis, -html
        . Miscellaneous options: -remote

    - The "-dbsize" option is useful for maintaining consistent statistics 
      over time as databases grow. If "-dbsize" is unset or set to 0, the 
      actual effective length of the database is used. As it is usually done 
      in the DB-split BLAST computations, the effective DB size should be 
      overridden in the BLAST call to be the entire length of the size 
      instead of the length of the current partition. To see the BLAST 
      database info use the below command:
      
      ex) $ blastdbcmd -info -db microbial_all.fa
      
            Database: microbial_all.fa
                    39,006 sequences; 8,538,182,741 total bases

            Date: Dec 8, 2011  12:57 PM     Longest sequence: 13,033,779 bases

            Volumes:
                    /work/01471/ssul/work/test/tutorial-test/blastdb/microbial_all.fa.00
                    /work/01471/ssul/work/test/tutorial-test/blastdb/microbial_all.fa.01


    - The mr-mpi-blast is a MPI program thus it should be run by "mpirun".
      
        . An example SGE job script  

            #!/bin/bash 
            #$ -A $SGE_ACCOUNT
            #$ -V # Inherit the submission environment 
            #$ -cwd # Start job in submission directory 
            #$ -N mrblast # Job Name 
            #$ -j y # Combine stderr and stdout 
            #$ -o $JOB_NAME.o$JOB_ID # Name of the output file  
            #$ -pe 16way 64  # Requests 16 tasks/node, 64 cores total 
            #$ -q development # Queue name 
            #$ -l h_rt=00:30:00 # Run time (hh:mm:ss) - 1.5 hours 
            mpirun mrblast -db - -evalue 1e-4 -dbsize 8538182741
      

* Input Files

    * NOTE: The mr-mpi-blast program assumes the cluster system supports a shared
      file system. All required input files should be accessible from all 
      processing units or ranks.
      

	- Input query sequence file 

      This should be a multi FASTA file. As mentioned, an index of sequence 
      offsets in the input FASTA file should be generated. 
      
	- Input index file and defline file (*.idx and *.def)

      The index file has the offset in the file and the length in 
      base-pair of each sequence and is used to logically split the query file 
      into blocks of sequences for distributing among workers in MapReduce 
      framework. 

      The "tools/seqindexer/seqindexer.py" is provided to generate the index 
      file. It also produces a defline file (.def) which stores the unique 
      query IDs and the corresponding part or full deflines of the input 
      sequences. This defline file is used to map the query ID to the defline
      and prints the defline in the final tabular hit list.
      
      You can select unique query ID option between serial number and gi. The 
      former assigns serial numbers starting from "1" for all input query 
      sequences. Also you can specify the starting number using "-s" option, if
      you want. On the other hand, the latter uses the original gi of the query
      sequence as its unique query ID. 

	  An example run of "seqindexer.py" and option description are following.	

        ex) $ python seqindexer.py -i 30_real_seqs.fa -o 30_real_seqs.fa.idx 
              -d 30_real_seqs.fa.def -u 1 -b 0
            $ python seqindexer.py -i 100_simul_seqs.fa -o 100_simul_seqs.fa.idx 
              -d 100_simul_seqs.fa.def -u 0 -s 0 -b 1

        Options:
        -i: input query file
        -o: output index file
        -d: output defline file; to store unique query ids and original deflines 
        -u: unique ID option; 0=serial number, 1=gi
        -s: if serial number option is selected, to specify the start number
        -b: defline saving option; 0=part, 1=full defline


      For more information, please refer to "tools/seqindexer/README" and 
      "tools/seqindexer/examples".

	- Subject database list file

      This file describes a list of subject database list. The format is 
      <db file name>. Each database file should be formatted in BLAST database 
      using either "formatdb" utility or blast+ "makeblastdb" utility. And the 
      files should exist in the current working directory or in the "BLASTDB" 
      path specified in the "[BLAST]" section of "~/.ncbirc" file.
      
	- Configuration file: mrblast.ini

                        items and mr-mpi-blast will iterate over the sub sets 
                        "n" times. The output file from each run can be 
                        distinguished by the iteration number in each file name.

        DBLISTFILENAME  set subject database list file name
        OUTFILEPREFIX   set file name prefix for output file names
        


* Output Files

    * NOTE: The mr-mpi-blast program assumes the cluster system supports a shared
      file system. All output files from workers are saved in a same location of 
      the share file system. 
      
	- BLAST search output files (*.bin)

      Once BLAST search is completed, each rank saves BLAST hit in each separate 
      binary file. The rank number will be added to the file name. Only the 
      tabular format is supported for now. 

      Tabular output format fields:
      <queryId, subjectid, identity, alignLen, nMismatches, nGaps, queryStart, 
      queryEnd, subjectStart, subjectEnd, evalue, bitScore>
	
	- Log files (*.log)

	  If LOGENABLED=1 in mrblast.ini, each rank saves detailed log in each 
      separate log file.

	- Strategy dump files (*-search_strategy.txt)

  	  If OPTDUMP=1, BLAST search strategy is dumped in 
      "OUTFILEPREFIX-search_strategy.txt" file.	


* Collecting and converting hit files    

    The resulting "*.bin" files are easily converted into HD5, SQLite, or 
    CSV files using the utilities provided under "tools/converter" directory. 
    For example, if "*.bin" files are saved in "./hits" directory, the below 
    commands collects and saves all hits from *.bin files into a output file.

    * NOTE: To use HD5 database format, PyTables should be installed 
            (http://www.pytables.org/moin/PyTablesPro).
   
    ex) $ python load_sql.py -b ./hits -o hits       # generates a sqlite file
    ex) $ python load_hd5.py -b ./hits -o hits       # generates a hd5 file
    ex) $ python load_csv.py -b ./hits -o hits       # generate a CSV file  
    
    
    If you want to add the original defline after the "qid" field, use "-d" 
    and "-i" options.
      
    ex) $ python load_sql.py -b ./hits -o hits_w_defline -d 1 -i 30_real_seq.fa.def
    ex) $ python load_csv.py -b ./hits -o hits_w_defline -d 1 -i 30_real_seq.fa.def
    

* Technical Considerations

    This section discusses on the critical parameters to run mr-mpi-blast 
    especially for large-scale BLAST search.     
    
    (1) Parameters related with MapReduce-MPI library
    
        We are using MPI MapReduce implementation called MapReduce-MPI. The  
        important parameters will be discussed in this section. For details, 
        please refer to the MapReduce-MPI documents. 

        - Out-of-core operation
          If the data owned by a processor for operating MapReduce fits within 
          one page, then no disk I/O is performed. However, if data exceeds the 
          page size, then it is written to temporary disk files and read back 
          in for subsequent operations and this is called out-of-core operation.
                  
        - Page size
          The page size determines the size (in Mbytes) of each page of 
          memory allocated by the MapReduce object to perform its 
          operations. The MapReduce-MPI requires 1 to 7 pages for its 
          run-time operation such as saving MapReduce key-value pairs. There is 
          no limitation of this size, but you should insure the total memory 
          consumed by all pages allocated by all the MapReduce objects you 
          create, does not exceed the physical memory available (which may 
          be shared by several processors if running on a multi-core node).
          If exceeded, then many systems will allocate virtual memory, 
          which will typically cause MR-MPI library operations to run very 
          slowly and thrash the disk. 
          
          If you allow the out-of-core operation and if you set MEMSIZE small, 
          then processing a large data set will induce many reads and writes to 
          disk. If you make it large, then the reads and writes will happen 
          in large chunks, which generally yields better I/O performance. 
          However, past a few MBytes in size, there may be little gain in 
          I/O performance. 
          
        - Map style (scheduler mode)
          The run-time option of MapReduce-MPI that instructs it to use the 
          process with rank 0 as a master that distributes work units to the 
          remaining ranks (“workers”) in a load-balanced way, such that each 
          worker is kept occupied as long as there are remaining work units. 
          This is especially important for an algorithm like BLAST which is 
          characterized by a highly non-uniform and unpredictable execution
          time depending on each query.              
          The mr-mpi-blast supports a location-aware master/worker scheduler in 
          which the master tries best to distribute the work items to those 
          ranks that have already been processing the same DB partitions. This The DB 
          object is cached between map() invocations on a given rank, and only 
          re-initialized if the different DB partition is required.
              
        
        In most cases, MAPSTYLE=3, MEMSIZE=64~128, and OUTOFCORE=0 settings should 
        be fine. For large-scale analysis, determining MEMSIZE and OUTOFCORE 
        might need preliminary test runs. By setting VERBOSITY=1 and with smaller 
        input data, it will be possible to estimate the total memory requirement 
        and proper options values. Allowing out-of-core operation is recommended, 
        but it could overload the underlying system with excessive disk I/O. 
        It is also recommended to place all input/out files on scratch disk if 
        supported. Too small page size will make the out-of-core operation 
        started. Too large page size should cause thrashing. Physical 
        partitioning of input query file can be considered as well. 
        
        Another important factor to consider is the size of database partitions. 
        The size should be considered when the database is formatted. Let's say  
        a node is consisted of 16 cores and has 32GB of combined RAM. If the 
        size of database partition is 1GB, total 16GB of combined 32GB RAM will 
        be consumed for database loading. Too small size will also affect the 
        performance because of frequent reloading of different database. Too 
        large size might cause out-of-memory. 
        
        For instance, we run a large-scale analysis by splitting a large query 
        file (~ 100GB) into 1 ~ 2GB partitions and with MEMSIZE=128 and 
        OUTOFCORE=-1. 500Mbp was set for the block size with one iteration. 
        As for the size of database, the default size (1GB) is used to format 
        database by using "blastformatdb" utility. We introduce one of our large 
        -scale experiment in "examples/refseq-all-vs-all/README".
        
    (2) Parameters related with mr-mpi-blast
    
        - Block size    
          To set the block size, use "BLOCKSIZE". The block size determines 
          the number of work items. You should decide to block size so that 
          you can have much more work items than the number of processing 
          units for maximum performance. Too small number of work 
          items can not fully utilize the load-balancing feature. If there is 
          large enough query file as input, 1MB of the block size is recommended.        
    
        - Iteration number
          In order to process large collection of queries, the mr-mpi-blast 
          supports "NUMITER" options for iterating the same MPI process by looping 
          over the consecutive subsets of the entire query set. In other words, 
          the set of total work items will be divided into "n" sub work 
          items and mr-mpi-blast will iterate over the sub sets "n" times. This 
          is for controlling the size of the intermediate key-value dataset that 
          has to be kept in the collective memory of the process ranks during
          each MapReduce cycle. As discussed, if the size of the dataset grows 
          beyond the page size limit, the performance will suffer, especially 
          on typical cluster architecture that has no locally attached user 
          scratch space on the computer nodes.
